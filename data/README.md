This project uses a subset of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database provided by PhysioNet.

## Description
The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database contains annotated ECG recordings used for the evaluation of arrhythmia detection algorithms.

- Sampling rate: 360 Hz
- Signal type: ECG (1–2 leads)
- Annotations: Beat-level arrhythmia labels

## Usage
Only a small subset of records is used for demonstration and educational purposes.

Raw data is not included in the repository.
Please download the dataset from PhysioNet and place the files into:
